Cut the mangoes and scoop out the flesh
put the flesh into the mixer grinder with appropriate amount of salt, sugar and milkto make it into a paste.
pour out the paste in a cooking vessel and start heating it.
Meanwhile, On another container take milk and corn flour and stir it thoroughly and set it aside.
Stir the paste and give it a good mix and wait for it to boil.
Once it starts boiling, mix the corn flour mixed milk in the paste while stiring it to prevent the corn from accumulating on teh bottom of the cooking pan.
We have to go on stiring teh mixture for a few minutes untill and unless it has become thick and there is no corn flour left undissolved.
Finaly we have to let it cool down a bit and then pour it in the serving contained and get it chilled.
We can serve it which a topping of some freshly chopped mangoes.
